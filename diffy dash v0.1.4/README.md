# TS4 — Diffy Cult Dashboard (v0.1.4)

**New**
- Scoring dropdown (Quick Add) that applies +/− SP directly and logs a short history.
- Keep the center gauge and ±1 buttons for fast tweaks.
- Full scoring lists are tucked behind a collapsible “Show full scoring lists” so the bottom is decluttered.
- Still no service worker (avoids caching surprises while we iterate).

**How to use**
1. Open `index.html` locally (double-click). Wheel links open in new tabs.
2. Use the Scoring select → Apply to add/remove SP; Undo last to revert one action.
3. The SP total and history are saved in your browser’s local storage.

When this feels right, I can re-enable offline caching as v0.1.5.
