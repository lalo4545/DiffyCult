### 🧭 Generational Arc Overview
Each generation has a verb—the act that defines its relationship to belief. Each action distorts or redeems what came before.

1. **Gen 1 — Builds** belief  
2. **Gen 2 — Doubts** it  
3. **Gen 3 — Spreads** it  
4. **Gen 4 — Fractures** it  
5. **Gen 5 — Heals** it  
6. **Gen 6 — Exploits** it  
7. **Gen 7 — Rejects** it  
8. **Gen 8 — Records** it  
9. **Gen 9 — Resurrects** it  
10. **Gen 10 — Transcends** it  

These verbs form the emotional skeleton of the Shadowpoint mythos.

### 👁️ The Leader Rule — *“All light must have a shadow.”*
**Active:** From Founder’s birth until the Pop-Corn Phase (Gen 1 → Gen 3)

- There must always be a **Leader of the Shadowpoint**.  
- Only the Leader may start or lead the cult club.  
- The Leader dictates tenets, income, and image.  
- If the Leader dies pre–Pop-Corn, immediately reincarnate or appoint a successor via **Life & Death** mechanics.

When Pop-Corn begins, decentralize: each branch now names its own Leader; the Founder becomes mythic.

**Scoring**  
+1 Shadowpoint per stable week of leadership before decentralization.  
+3 if the Founder dies with a successor ready.  
−2 for any leaderless week.

---

### 🔮 The Heir Rule — *“Every light returns as its own shadow.”*
Each generation begins with the Leader’s rebirth within the bloodline.

- The new heir must be a child or descendant of the prior Leader.  
- Carry one inherited trait or aspiration.  
- The birth household becomes the **Chosen Branch**.  

**Lost Rebirths:** If the Leader’s soul manifests outside the family, mark −3 Shadowpoints and trigger a week of penance: build a **Shrine of Return** (≥ §5 000) and live ascetically—simple meals, meditation, no romance or business. +1 Shadowpoint restored after the ritual.

---

### 🌾 Gen 1 — The Believer (“Builds Belief”)  
The Founder must build a solid foundation of faith.

- Begin with § 0–1,800 and minimal furnishings.  
- Traits: Creative / Self‑Absorbed / Mystical.  
- Aspiration: Wellness Guru or Zen Master.  
- Leaders may **never** hold traditional careers; their time belongs entirely to the creed and its followers.  
- Grow or craft essential goods before purchasing duplicates.

**Faith Infrastructure:**  
You must fill all **three social groups** (maximum without mods) entirely with your own followers. No Sim may belong to more than one group. If a member dies, replace them immediately to keep the faith whole.

**Leadership Structure:**  
The Leader of the cult holds authority over all three groups. Splinter groups are encouraged and may evolve during later generations, but the primary three must remain intact.

**Maintenance Rule:**  
These three groups must be maintained throughout the entire legacy. After Gen 1, every empty club slot counts as −1 Shadowpoint per week until filled.

**Goal:** Build self‑sufficiency, establish the creed, and convert your first full set of disciples.  
**Bonus:** +1 Shadowpoint per Sim successfully converted or recruited. (“Builds Belief”)  
Rags to riches; wellness to faith.  
Start broke, found the creed, build self-sufficiency, and convert followers.  
Earn the first 50 000 § without outside work.  

---

### 🌗 Gen 2 — The Doubter (“Questions Faith”)  
A reincarnated Founder, now born into comfort. This generation seeks truth through science before rediscovering spirit.

- Begin in the Science career; pursue breakthroughs and inventions as a means to measure the unmeasurable.
- Maintain an heir apparent chosen by the faithful while the true Leader hides behind the microscope.
- Must complete the full Science career track before retirement.
- Upon retirement, shift to Wellness or Guru aspirations; teach mindfulness, accept that family is the laboratory of love.
- The generation ends when the scientist publishes their final discovery and renames it after the family’s original creed.

 (“Questions Faith”)  
Lives in the Founder’s comfort, privately skeptical.  
Experiments with pleasure, mischief, and hypocrisy while keeping the shrine alive.  
Sets the stage for reform.  

---

### 🌕 Gen 3 — The Prophet (“Spreads Faith”)  
Born inside a thriving, structured faith, this reincarnation rises through ranks to professionalize devotion.  

- Begin with the faith already established by previous generations.  
- Pursue the **Fabulously Wealthy** and **Mansion Baron** aspirations on the home lot.  
- Build the cult’s public brand—businesses, merchandise, wellness retreats, or media ventures that carry the Shadowpoint name.  
- Must achieve millionaire status and complete **both** aspirations. If the Prophet dies before completing both, the household must serve **Penance for Rebirth**—a seven‑day austerity period of meditation, fasting, and abstaining from wealth activities until the reincarnation is secured.  
- Maintain the three cult clubs founded by Gen 1; they now function as subsidiary brands.  
- The Prophet must also **populate** the world: produce a minimum of **four children**, each destined to lead or seed a new household in the coming Pop‑Corn Phase.  
- When wealth and expansion reach critical mass, prepare for decentralization.  

**Goal:** Transform faith into a thriving brand empire.  
**End Condition:** Once multiple lots are active, initiate the Pop‑Corn Phase.  

---

### 🍿 Pop‑Corn Phase (Gen 4 → Gen 6)
*“The world no longer waits for the Leader’s voice.”*  
Enable Story Progression, auto‑age, and full autonomy. Each week spin a wheel to choose which branch to play.  
Every household interprets the faith differently:
- Gen 4 — **Fractures** it  → schisms and rival creeds.  
- Gen 5 — **Heals** it  → reconciliation, inter‑branch festivals.  
- Gen 6 — **Exploits** it  → turns doctrine into profit.  

Chaos is the test of belief.  

---

### ☯️ Life & Death Protocol — *“No soul ever leaves unchanged.”*  
Active from Gen 3 onward.  

**Life Path:**  Aspirational deaths earn resurrection. After one day, respawn and spin the **Rebirth Wheel** to assign a new branch. Keep one trait. (+3 Shadowpoints)

**Afterlife Wheel:**  Unfulfilled deaths roll for:  
    – **Spirit Guide** (ghost mentor, +2)  
    – **Release** (urn destroyed, −1)

Every ten weeks hold **The Great Reckoning**—a ritual where all ghosts gather; spin for Reunion, Uprising, or Peace to set the week’s mood.

---

### 🌘 Late Legacy (Gen 7 → Gen 10)
After the Pop‑Corn storm, the faith’s echoes solidify.
- **Gen 7 — Rejects it:** breaks with tradition, lives off‑grid, symbolic exile.  
- **Gen 8 — Records it:** becomes historian; writes or paints the cult’s chronicles.  
- **Gen 9 — Resurrects it:** revives rituals in modern form, blends tech and mysticism.  
- **Gen 10 — Transcends it:** balances all prior ideals; chooses to end or renew the cycle.

### Epilogue
Each generation builds upon the ashes of the last. The Shadowpoint legacy isn’t about perfection—it’s about evolution. Belief mutates, leaders fall, and souls return wearing new faces until the line either finds balance or burns out.
