### 👁️ The Leader Rule — *"All light must have a shadow."*
**Active:** From Founder’s birth until Pop-Corn Phase (Gen 1–Gen 3)

- There must always be a **Leader of the Shadowpoint**.
- Only the Leader may start or lead the cult club.
- The Leader directs all tenets: rituals, rules, public image.
- All household income funnels through the Leader (symbolic tithe).
- If the Leader dies before Pop-Corn begins, immediately reincarnate or appoint a successor using **Life & Death** mechanics.

**During Pop-Corn Phase:** decentralize power. Each branch gains its own Leader; the original becomes mythic.

**Score Bonuses**  
+1 Shadowpoint per stable week of leadership pre-Pop-Corn.  
+3 if the Founder dies with a successor already prepared.  
−2 for each week leaderless.

---

### 🔮 The Heir Rule — *"Every light returns as its own shadow."*
**Active:** Generations 2→10

**Rebirth Requirement:**  
When a Leader dies or ascends, their next life must begin **within the family tree** as a baby born to any direct or collateral descendant.

- Create or adopt a child linked by bloodline.
- Carry over one trait or aspiration from the prior life.
- That household becomes the **Chosen Branch**.

**Cycle of Names:**  
Gen 2 marks the Founder’s first return; Gen 3 repeats the cycle. By now, the creed should have drifted—the child grows up among myths of their past self.

**Genetic Drift Clause:**  
Inter-branch marriages are encouraged *after* reincarnation to mirror doctrinal spread. The rebirth itself must remain inside the lineage—any soul born beyond it is considered **Lost**.

**Scoring & Penance**  
| Event | Shadowpoints |
|:--|:--:|
| Successful reincarnation within family tree | +3 |
| **Lost Rebirth** – soul returns outside branch lines | −3 → Trigger Penance |
| Penance fulfilled (Shrine of Return, 1 week) | +1 |
| Genetic anomaly (twin/alien birth) | +2 lore bonus |

**Penance Ritual:**  
The responsible household must build a **Shrine of Return** worth ≥§ 5 000. For one week they live ascetically—simple food, daily meditation, no romance or business. Afterward, +1 Shadowpoint is restored.

---

### 🌾 Generation 1 — The Believer (*"From Dust to Dharma"*)
- Start with § 0–1,800, empty lot, minimal furnishings.
- Traits: Creative / Self-Absorbed / Mystical.
- Aspiration: Wellness Guru or Zen Master.
- No jobs until your first self-made income loop.
- Grow/craft essentials before buying duplicates.
- No clubs until you can afford the initiation space.

**Goal:** Build a fully self-sustaining household (garden, generator, pond) and reach § 50 000 net worth.  
**Bonus:** +1 Shadowpoint per Sim converted to your teachings.

---

### 🌗 Generation 2 — The Doubter
Lives in comfort, questions the creed. Bend the rules but never shatter them—yet.
- Explore pleasure or mischief aspirations.
- Publicly distance from cult image.
- Secretly maintain shrine to Founder.

---

### 🌕 Generation 3 — The Prophet: The Great Expansion
The first true revivalist. Declares a new age and spreads the philosophy.
- Must have **4 children** minimum—each destined for their own lot or club.
- Found the secondary lots that form the Pop-Corn network.
- Optional business or wellness empire.

**Goal:** Build the infrastructure for the Pop-Corn Phase.

---

### 🍿 Pop-Corn Phase (Generations 4–6)
*"The world no longer waits for the Leader's voice."*

**Setup:**
- Enable Auto-Age (Unplayed Sims) and Neighborhood Stories.
- Keep 3–4 branch households alive.
- Each Sim week, spin the **Pop-Corn Wheel** to choose which branch to play.

**Examples:**  
– Return to Founder’s House.  
– Tend the Prophet’s Business.  
– Visit Heretic’s Commune.  
– Attend the Healer’s Festival.  

Let chaos bloom. Autonomy stays full; aging stays on. Watch ideology mutate across households.

---

### ☯️ Life & Death Protocol — *"No soul ever leaves unchanged."*
**Active:** Gen 3 onward.

**Life Path:**  
When a Sim dies naturally *and* has completed an aspiration, they may respawn after one day. Spin the **Rebirth Wheel** to place them in a new Pop-Corn household. Keep one random trait.

+3 Shadowpoints for each successful reincarnation.

**Afterlife Wheel:**  
If a Sim dies unfulfilled, spin to determine fate:
- **Spirit Guide** – remains in household tomb; can mentor once per generation (+2).
- **Release** – urn destroyed or released (−1).

**Optional: The Great Reckoning**  
Every ten Sim weeks, gather all urns for a ritual. Spin for *Reunion, Uprising,* or *Peace* to set the household mood for the week.

---

### Epilogue
Shadowpoint is less a challenge than an ecosystem. Every spin of a wheel, every rebirth, and every shrine builds its own theology. The goal isn’t perfection—it’s to watch belief evolve until even the Founder wouldn’t recognize it.
