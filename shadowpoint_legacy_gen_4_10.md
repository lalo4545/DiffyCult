## Shadowpoint Legacy v1.2.0 — Generational Lore Expansion Draft
*A legacy of faith, power, and mutation for The Sims 4*

---

### 🌾 Gen 1 — The Believer (“Builds Belief”)

---

### 🌗 Gen 2 — The Doubter (“Questions Faith”)

---

### 🌕 Gen 3 — The Prophet (“Spreads Faith”)

---

### 🍿 Gen 4 — The Opulents (“Fractures Faith”)  
For Generation 4, using **Big Happy Family** as the aspiration works beautifully. It’s ironic because the wealth and opulence of Gen 3’s empire create over‑indulgence and fractures: they’re surrounded by family yet emotionally isolated. The win condition is to maintain harmony and relationships among the multiple splinter households while keeping the cult intact. Pop‑Corn Phase (Gen 4 → Gen 6)
*“The world no longer waits for the Leader's voice.”*  

---

### 🌅 Gen 5 — The Rebuilders (“Heals Faith”)  
Sensing the divide, Generation 5 seeks to rebuild what was lost and bring the family back to its roots. The Leader relocates the cult to a new area, symbolizing a second founding.

- No formal aspiration.  
- You **must move the cult to a new location** and begin again on a lot no larger than **40×30**.  
- Spend **one full played week with no shelter**—treat this as a retreat or camping period for the Leader’s household.  
- The week in the wild represents reconnection, humility, and renewal.  
- After this week, you may begin rebuilding from scratch, inviting family branches back together.

**Goal:** Recenter the faith by living its simplest form; reconcile at least two splinter households into a single gathering or event before the week ends.

---

### 💪 Gen 6 — The Exhibitors (“Exploits Faith”)  
After years in exile, the family learns the old estate was never sold—it’s been gathering dust, waiting for a comeback. Generation 6 returns to reclaim it and polish the family’s image.

- Aspiration: **Bodybuilder** or **Entertainer** (focus on physical beauty and performance).  
- Leaders in this generation are permitted a career for the first time since the Founder—they may pursue Fitness or Entertainment paths to embody perfection and influence.  
- Restore and renovate the ancestral home to full glory.  
- Create and sell a **new product, show, or persona** symbolizing the family’s perfection—this could be a performance brand, wellness empire, or social celebrity identity.  
- Showcase success through fame, public events, or tournaments.  
- Maintain appearances: no negative moodlets during public appearances.  
- **Must reach maximum Fame** before the generation ends; fame represents the cult’s glittering mask of perfection.  

**Goal:** Demonstrate the Shadowpoint legacy’s physical and performative perfection to the world, masking the moral fractures underneath.

### ☯️ Life & Death Protocol — *“No soul ever leaves unchanged.”*

---

### 🐑 Gen 7 — The Outcast (“Rejects Faith”)  
The black sheep generation. Disillusioned by the fame‑obsessed Exhibitors, this Leader walks away from the social machine.

- Temporary relief from the cult’s **social group** rule: you may leave or disband your clubs for this generation only.  
- Aspiration: **Writer** or **Media Production (Podcaster/Author)** — channel isolation into creative expression.  
- Must live off‑grid or away from the family estate for at least one full played week.  
- Limited contact: visit relatives no more than once per Sim week.  
- The social groups still exist under NPC management, and their decay will have consequences next generation.  
- May pursue writing or podcast careers to voice dissent, irony, or memoirs of the cult’s decline.  

**Goal:** Rediscover selfhood beyond doctrine; survive happily in isolation without letting the old faith collapse entirely.  

**Goal:** Rediscover selfhood beyond doctrine; survive happily in isolation without letting the old faith collapse entirely.

### 🔮 Gen 8 — The Prophecy (“Records Faith”)  
Born back inside the faith, this reincarnation is seen as the long‑awaited prophecy—proof that the creed still holds power. In cult politics, the rebirth of a prophesied leader reignites belief: when they die, the movement renews itself.  

- Must be **reborn within the family line** after the Outcast’s departure; cannot be an outsider adoption or random spawn.  
- From birth, the household treats the child as sacred—guarded, celebrated, and burdened with expectation.  
- Aspiration: **Academic** or **Archaeology Scholar** (seeking evidence of the Founder’s truth).  
- The Leader must rebuild the social clubs and repair all decayed groups from prior generations.  
- Upon their eventual death, perform a full family gathering; the cult enters a period of renewal and resets its Shadowpoints to zero for the next generation.  

**Goal:** Restore structure, re‑establish doctrine, and ensure your death gives the faith new life.

---

### 🕊️ Gen 9 — The Pilars (“Resurrects Faith”)  
Following the renewal sparked by the Prophecy’s death, this generation views the cult’s long endurance as proof of divine favor. Their unity becomes spectacle—solidarity displayed through structure and control.  

- A **second member of your household** must now also maintain **three full clubs** of new members—these represent the next wave of believers.  
- The Leader must complete at least **three aspirations from previous generations** as an act of devotion and fortitude.  
- Focus on community events, festivals, and public gatherings that showcase loyalty and shared history.  
- Keep all clubs active simultaneously to demonstrate unbroken faith.  

**Goal:** Display the strength of legacy through relentless structure; prove the Shadowpoint faith endures because it adapts and multiplies.

---

### 🌄 Gen 10 — The Liberated (“Transcends Faith”)  
At the end of generations of doctrine, spectacle, and rebirth, this Leader finally loosens their grip. They realize what they sought was never control or perfection—only community.  

- Freeplay generation: no required aspiration, goals, or penalties.  
- Focus on relationships, joy, and shared moments rather than faith metrics.  
- May merge all remaining households or let them drift naturally.  
- Optional aspiration: **Friend of the World** or **Good Vampire** (if applicable) to symbolize connection without control.  

**Goal:** Embrace freedom from doctrine. Build or rebuild community for its own sake, not as proof of enlightenment.
